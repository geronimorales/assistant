# AI Assistant Project Brief

## Project Overview
This is a FastAPI-based AI assistant that uses LangChain, LangGraph, and LlamaIndex for AI capabilities, with PostgreSQL as the database.

## Core Requirements
- Build a robust AI assistant API using FastAPI
- Integrate with LangChain, LangGraph, and LlamaIndex for AI capabilities
- Use PostgreSQL for data persistence
- Implement proper API documentation and testing
- Follow functional programming principles
- Maintain clean, maintainable code structure

## Technical Stack
- Python 3.9+
- FastAPI for API framework
- LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex for AI capabilities
- PostgreSQL for database
- Poetry for dependency management
- Alembic for database migrations

## Project Goals
1. Create a scalable and maintainable AI assistant API
2. Implement proper error handling and logging
3. Ensure code quality through testing
4. Maintain comprehensive documentation
5. Follow functional programming best practices

## Success Criteria
- API endpoints are well-documented and tested
- AI capabilities are properly integrated
- Database operations are efficient and secure
- Code follows functional programming principles
- Project is properly documented and maintainable
