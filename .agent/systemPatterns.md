# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The system follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/assistant/
├── api/        # API routes and endpoints
├── core/       # Core configuration and settings
├── db/         # Database models and configuration
├── models/     # Pydantic models
└── services/   # Business logic and services
```

## Design Patterns
1. **Dependency Injection**
   - Services are injected into API routes
   - Configuration is managed through settings

2. **Repository Pattern**
   - Database operations are abstracted through repositories
   - Clear separation between data access and business logic

3. **Service Layer Pattern**
   - Business logic is encapsulated in services
   - Services handle complex operations and orchestration

4. **Factory Pattern**
   - Used for creating AI model instances
   - Allows for easy switching between different providers

## Component Relationships
1. **API Layer**
   - Handles HTTP requests and responses
   - Validates input using Pydantic models
   - Delegates to services for business logic

2. **Service Layer**
   - Implements business logic
   - Coordinates between different components
   - Handles error cases and edge conditions

3. **Data Layer**
   - Manages database operations
   - Implements data models and migrations
   - Handles data persistence and retrieval

## Critical Implementation Paths
1. **Request Flow**
   - API endpoint receives request
   - Request is validated using Pydantic models
   - Service layer processes the request
   - Database operations are performed if needed
   - Response is returned to client

2. **Error Handling**
   - Validation errors are caught at API layer
   - Business logic errors are handled in services
   - Database errors are managed in repositories
   - All errors are logged and tracked

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Environment variables are loaded through settings
   - Configuration is validated on startup
   - Settings are accessible throughout the application
