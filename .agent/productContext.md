# Product Context

## Purpose
The AI Assistant project aims to provide a robust and flexible API for AI-powered assistance. It serves as a foundation for building intelligent applications that can understand and respond to user queries using advanced language models.

## Problems Solved
1. Need for a standardized API for AI capabilities
2. Integration of multiple AI frameworks (LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex)
3. Efficient data persistence and retrieval
4. Scalable and maintainable AI service architecture

## User Experience Goals
1. Fast and reliable API responses
2. Clear and comprehensive API documentation
3. Easy integration with other systems
4. Consistent error handling and feedback
5. Secure and private data handling

## How It Should Work
1. Users can make requests to the API endpoints
2. The system processes requests using AI capabilities
3. Results are stored in PostgreSQL for persistence
4. Responses are returned in a consistent format
5. All operations are logged for monitoring and debugging

## Key Features
1. AI-powered query processing
2. Data persistence and retrieval
3. API documentation and testing
4. Error handling and logging
5. Security and privacy controls
